Wordle Game (C++ + SFML)

A graphical implementation of the classic Wordle game built using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This project was developed as a way to practice object-oriented design, GUI programming, file I/O, and C++ fundamentals.

Features

Interactive graphical interface

Random word generation from answer list

Word validation from dictionary

On-screen keyboard with colored feedback

Username input and leaderboard tracking

Persistent scoring system

Compatible with Windows and Linux

To install SFML:

SFML Installation Guide

Build Instructions

Using the Provided Makefile

make        # Builds the project
./main      # Runs the game

Make sure the SFML libraries are correctly linked and available in your system path or compilation setup.

Gameplay Instructions

Launch the game and enter your username

Try to guess the 5-letter word in 6 attempts

Letters are color-coded based on correctness:

🟩 Green = Correct letter and position

🟨 Yellow = Correct letter, wrong position

⬛ Gray = Letter not in word

If you win, your score is saved and averaged

View the leaderboard at the end

File Descriptions

answers.txt: List of correct answers (randomly selected)

allwords.txt: Full list of acceptable guesses

scores.txt: Stores scores in format score,username

What I Learned

Handling window events and rendering with SFML

Managing game states and UI transitions

Validating user input and managing string data

Reading/writing structured data from text files

Organizing C++ code for clarity and extensibility
